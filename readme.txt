The easiest way to increase your store conversion by offering discounts for your visitors.

== Description ==

Newsletter discounts for WooCommerce will help you increase your store conversions and make more sales by offering special prices for your visitors who subscribe to your newsletter. 

A beautiful popup form will welcome your visitors with a special offer. Your customers can easily and simply unlock the discount by subscribing to your newsletter. 

A special coupon code will be created for each visitor who chooses to unlock the special discount offer. The coupon code will be applied immediately on their cart. 

As a store owner, you can customize the amount and the type of the discounts, the products  and the product categories on which you want it to be applied on, and of course: FREE SHIPPING.

When a visitor unlocks the offer, their email will be exported immediately to your newsletter service of choice. We currently support Mailchimp, Klaviyo and Drip. This will help you make your email re-targeting way more efficient!

This plugin is completely compliant with GDPR laws. If you choose to enabled them, GDPR fields will be added to the popup form, and your visitors will have to consent before their information is submitted to your store.
